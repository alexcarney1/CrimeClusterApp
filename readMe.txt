I was a criminal justice minor during my undergraduate studies and was always curious to do some data analysis on crime data. I was originally going to do analysis on
some formula 1 sensor data, but after the clustering lesson, thought that this would be far more interesting. I plan on delievering a Shiny app showing the results of this
cluster analysis. I am hoping to make it dynamic (ability to view the results across years, specific to different cities, states, change parameters,etc) via the Shiny app.
This would lend itself to doing something cool with overlaying data on to maps, if that is possible via Shiny. The goal of my app would be to get a feel for how different
states and cities have evolved in their criminal activity over the last few years. It could maybe lend insight into how public resources or policing should be targeted towards
or away from certain areas. 

I am toying with the idea of incorporating ecnonomic data alongside the crime data in some way to correlate them. I am rusty on statistics so I am not sure how that would play
along with my cluster analysis. Maybe you would have some ideas...

Also, I plan on using these datasets, from various years:

I want to think about this and the objectives more and get more clarity before writing code.
